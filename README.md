# Brasileirao-Data
Project designed to gather and clean data from the brazilian football league from the API-Football api.

# Setup
In order to run this program, you are gonna have to sign up on the [API-Football](https://www.api-football.com/pricing) website. You can sign up for free with up to 100 request a day. When you're done setting up your account, an access token will be given to you, which will be used in the request headers. To use the access token in the program, you're gonna have to create a config.py file with the following variable:

```
api_football_key = YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

And that's it! Now you can make requests to the API and gather football fixtures from your favorite leagues. Enjoy!
